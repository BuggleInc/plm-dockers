# plm-dockers

Docker images for the environment of **PLM**

### How to use

The main Docker images are already available on our [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/buggleinc/).

If you want to rebuild them or to edit them, you will find in the *dockerfile/* directory the configuration files to build the Docker images of the components of **PLM**.
Some scripts are also available to ease the building process.

Then in the *docker-compose/* directory, several configurations are available to deploy a part of the environment or the full one.
